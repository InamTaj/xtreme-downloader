# eXtreme Downloader

eXtreme Downloader is a java-based Multi-Threaded Download manager that downloads files in such a way that it creates multiple threads to request a file from download server, therefore file download speed increases upto 5x with comparison to traditional single threaded downloading.
The downloader is platform independent and I even currently use it to download files on my Linux OS.
